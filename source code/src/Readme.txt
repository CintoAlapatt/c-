* A plain-text file named README.txt which contains a description of how your program operates. In particular, if your program has any special features (e.g., animation, command-line arguments, etc.) or limitations, you should describe them here so that the grader is aware of them.

The program compiles like any other assignment framework and gives the output. All the files are given in the zip  file. The program was checked to run on a cs machine and it compiled.
